CS444 hw4 supplied files
Note: start from these sources for either project.  They have
been edited from the hw3.soln files is a few ways.  To find out
exactly how, do a directory diff (diff $cs444/hw3.soln $cs444/hw4).

uprog[123].c: old uprog*.c 
testmutex[123].c: user program testing simple mutex
testmutex.sh: for running testmutex.lnx under mtip
testmutex-provided.out: output of "testmutex.sh 6" showing
  lack of mutex
prodcons[123].c: user program using semaphores for producer-consumer
prodcons.sh: for running prodcons.lnx under mtip
prodcons-provided.out: output of "prodcons.sh 6" showing
  producer outrunning consumer and failing to enqueue items

makefile: set up for build of these programs (make U=testmutex), 
  but lack of semaphore syscalls means they don't work properly

Changes from hw3.soln:
debuglog.c: reimplemented to be more robust in cases of data corruption
makefile: entries for new files
